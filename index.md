### Issues and Updates

#### Challenge 00
1/16/2019 -  I needed to create a Google Ads acoount and they require a webpage to sign up. The documentation I was given didn't give us one to use and I didn't feel comfortable using some random site...so here we are.

Google Ads issue had a workaround that didnt need a site. I was able to click a link at the bottom of the page that said "I'm a profesional" and that allowed me to go staright to the console to be able to find my ID without creating a campaign.

1/21/2019 - Solved my issue with the account creation completion for the google search console using the git hub IO page. I was successfully able to just add the html verification file to the repo and it allowed me to prove that I was the domains owner.

### Random

**for the experience!**

```javascript
[] + [] //''

[] + {} //[object Object]

{} + [] //0

console.log('WAT!')

```
